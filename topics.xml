	<text>Four Ancient Christmaas Carols
The ancient Christmas carol
"Holy Night" is German in its
origin and is considered by
many persons to be the most
beautiful of all Christmas carols. It
has sometimes been ascribed to Martin
Luther, but the consensus of expert
opinion is that it is much older than
his time and is one of the oldest of
German folk songs.
The carol "God Rest Ye Merry, Gen-
tlemen," is English in its origin and
dates back to about the beginning of
the seventeenth century, although the
author of the words and the composer
of the music are unknown. The fine
old melody sung to this poem pos-
sesses all the best qualifications of a
sterling hymn tune and will probably
ast as long as the verses with which
it is always associated.
Originally the old carol was sung in
polyphonic harmony with the melody
placed in the tenor, as was the invari-
able custom of the seventeenth cen-
tury. Modern transcriptions of it,
however, have placed the melody in
the upper voice part instead of the
third voice part, as formerly. This
carol, too, is one of the most popular
and most beautiful in the entire range
of Christmas music.
The carol "Draw Nigh, Immanuel,"
is one of the oldest pieces of coherent
music in existence, and both the words
and music far antedate any of the
others. The music is an old French
melody, dated from the thirteenth cen-
tury, although, of course, it has been
harmonized to conform with more mod-
ern standards.
There is a most curious but beauti-
ful musical effect at the close of this
carol. The words of "Draw Nigh, Im-
manuel," are about 100 years older
than the music, being taken from the
Mozarablc breviary of the twelfth cen-
tury, and it is generally believed that
they were taken from the liturgy of
the early Christians at Toledo, Spain,
where the Mozarable breviary was for-
mulated.
Another carol, "The First Noel," has
a traditional French melody and prob-
ably originated in Breton, although the
exact origin of this fine old song is
somewhat in doubt.
