	<text>What the Christmas "Waits" Sing
SANTA CLAUS being about to de
sert tbe city streets tor bis annual
reindeer ride over tbe roofs, tbe
"waits" prepare to sing their centuries
old carols.
In several American cities bas been
revived tbe beautiful old custom of the
"waits" going about from bouse to
house singing tbe familiar old songs.
Light tbe Christmas candles In your
window If you want them to stop be
fore your borne!
Qod rest you merry, gentlemen; let
nothing you dismay
tbey will surely sing that, perhaps the
best known of all old English carols.
And this too:
Bark! The herald angels ting,
Qlorv to the newborn king.
And, of course, "0 Little Town ot
Bethlehem."
Perhaps, too, they will -slug what is
said to be tbe earliest kuown Christ
mas carol, dating from tbe Anglo-Norman
days of the thirteenth century,
which begins
Lordlingt, listen to our lay
We have come from far away
To seek Christmas.
In this mansion we are told
Be hit yearly feast doth hold;
1 'Tit today!
Hay joy come from Qod above
To all those who Christmat love.
This carol ends with tbe toast of
those days:
"Here, then, I bid you all wassail,
cursed be be who will not say drink
bail." "Wassail" meaning your health
and "driukbail" being tbe usual and
courteous acknowledgment.
One of tbe best known of all the old
carols, although not one of the oldest,
was written by JVuhuin Tate In 1703
and is called the "Soug of the Angels."
It begins
While shepherds watched their flocks
by night.
All seated on the ground,
The angel of the Lord came down
And glory shone around.
Many are the carols in which Brit
ain's ancient holly figures. "Then
drink to the holly berry," pledges one
writer of songs, while unother In "Un
der the Holly Bough" summons "All ye
ed friend or brother, come gather here."
And then there's that grand old hymn,
"Adeste Fldelea," sung in every church
In this land and in others, at this
Christmas season
Oh, come, all ye faithful,
Joyful and triumphant!
Come ye, tth, come ye to Bethlehem!
Christmas would not Le Christmas,
of course, If the "waits" were to neg
lect one other of tbe most beautiful of
old carols:
Boly night, peaceful night!
Through the darkness beams a light.
Boly night, peaceful night!
Through the darkness beams a light!
.Yonder, where they sweet vigils keep
O'er the babe who, in silent sleep,
Restt in heavenly peace,
Rests in heavenly peace.
If there are any of you who bave
in mind an after Christmas dinner even
ing of song to the accompaniment of a
harpsichord, a spinet, a lute or a piano
or even the modern and much adver
tised disk machine, it might be well to
try this on the company:
"Hark th. Herald Angeli Sing."""
Bark! The herald angels ting,
Olory to the newborn king;
Peace on earth and mercy mild,
Qod and sinners reconciled!
Joyful, all t'O nations, rise,
Join Vie triumph of the skies,
WUh the angelic host proclaim
Christ it born in Bethlehem.
Bark! The herald angelt ting,
Glory to the newborn king!

	<text>Four Ancient Christmas Carols
THE ancient Curlatmng carol
"Holy Night" la German In lte
origin and la considered by
ninny persona to be the most
beautiful of all Christmas carols. It
has HometlmeH been ascribed to Martin
Luther, hut tho consensus of expert
opinion Is that it Is much older than
his time anil Is one of the oldest of
(iciuiun folk songs.
The enrol "(iod Heat Ye Merry, Gen
tlemen," Is ICngllsh In Its origin and
bites bmk to about the beginning of
the Ni'venteeiilh century, ulttiongh the
author of the words and the composer
of the mush; are unknown. The fine
old melody sung to this poem pos
sesses all the best qualifications of a
sterling hymn tune and will probably
last as long as the verses with which
It Is always assocluted.
Originally the old carol was sung In
polyphonic harmony with the melody
placed In the t r, ns was the Invari
able custom of the seventeenth cen
tury. Modern transcription of It,
however, have placed tho melody In
the upper voice part Instead of the
third voice part, as formerly. Thla
carol, too, Is one of the most popular
and most beautiful In the entire range
of Christmas music
The carol "Draw Nigh, Immanuel,"
Is one of the oldest pieces of coherent
music In existence, and both the words
and music far antedute any of the
others. The music Is an old French
melody, dated from the thirteenth cen
tury, although, of course, It has been
harmonized to conform with more mod
ern standnrds.
There Is a most curious but beauti
ful ujusleul effect at the close of this
enrol. The words of "Draw Nigh. Im
manuel." are about 100 years older
than the music, being taken from the
Mozarablc breviary of the twelfth cen
tury, and It Is generally believed that
they were taken from the liturgy of
the early Christians at Toledo, Spain,
where the Mozarablc breviary wag for
mulated. Another carol, "The First Noel," has
a traditional French melody end prob
ably originated lu Breton, although tho
exact origin of this One old eons; la
somewhat la doubt

IS THE Christmas Carol com
ing back to its own as a
time-honored feature of the
Christmas Tide? It looks
so. And it Is to be hoped
that it is so. For the sing
ing of Christmas Carols will
WvyirJ help to popularize the religi
ous observance of the day—
which is losing ground year by year in
this material age.
Probably there is no room in our
Twentieth Century civilization for
carol-singing after the old way. But
carol-singing on a large scale is ad
mirable —as many American cities
abundantly proved in 1924. It was
made a community service. Many
singers were enlisted and trained.
Carols were sung in hospitals, orphan
ages and other institutions. The mes
sage of home was carried to the travel
er in hotels and railroad stations.
Mass-singing In municipal auditoriums
was received with popular acclaim.
This community service was strangely
reminiscent of the old-time “Waits”—
street muslcluns who were an estab
lished institution of English cities,
weurlng “Walts badges,” with the
town arms.
The singing of carols Is much older
than Christmas, just as the midwinter
festival of good cheer long antedates
the celebration of Christmas as the
anniversary of the birth of Christ. The
pagan Britons celebrated this midwin
ter festival; so did the Jtomuns and
many European peoples. It was not
until the Fourth Century that this fes
tival became identified with the church
festival of Christmas —“Christ-mass."
Have you discovered that it’s very
easy Indeed to dance to some of the
Christmas Carols? Well, It is. And
that’s because “Carol” was originally
a term for a dance —or for songs In
termingled with dancing. It was a
long time before- the word came to
be applied strictly to a religious
Christmas song.
Primitive man makes merry, you
know, in song and dance and boister
ous play. It is not hard to see in the
Christmas of modern times plain evi
dence of the pagan origin of mid
winter festivities. The “Yule Log”
undoubtedly spread from the ancient
Lithuanians and Letts, whose “Christ
mas Eve” was “Log Evening.”, The
Their Christmas Task
“If I have to lick another stamp,”
declared Tessle Tongue, "I absolutely
won’t have enough energy to talk, and
that’s my chief business.”
“If I have to scratch off another
address,” scolded Hannah Hand, “I
shan't be able to life a tinger for a
month.”

The Christmas Carol goes back a
long way into early English life. The
first printed collection came in 1521
from the press of Wynkin de Worde.
This early master-printer was prob
ably born in Lorraine and went to
London to be assistant to Caxton.
whom he succeeded la XUfl. It Is inter
esting to know that a fragment of this
edition is still extaitf and contains the
famous “Boar’s Head Carol,” which
is stilt sung on Christmas Day in
Queen’s College, Oxford —whether the
serving of the boar’s head on a silver
platter in the big dining hall still ob
tains, one is not prepared to say.. In
the old days the serving of the boar’s
head, with much pomp and ceremony
and minstrelsy and song wns the
feature of the Christmas feast in the
homes of the wealthy and great. The
authentic wording of this carol is as
follows:
The boar's head In hand bear I,
Bedeck'd with hays and rosemary;
And I pray you, my masters, be merry,
Quot estis In convivio.
Caput aprl defero,
Reddens la'udes Domino.
The boar's head, as I understand,
Is the rarest dish In all this land,.
Which thus bedeck'd with a gay garland
Let us servlre cantico
Caput defero, etc.
Our steward hath provided this
In honor of the King of Bliss,
Which on this day to be served Is
In Reginensl Atrio,
Caput apri defero, etc.
At the time Wynkin de Worde pub
lished the first collection of Christmas
Carols in 1521 carol-singing was a uni
versal practice in England. In 1525,
when Henry VIII lay ill, there was on
edict specifically prohibiting “carols,
bells or merry-making.” In 1526 a
license was issued to Thomas Trysdale
to print, “Certayne goodly Carowles to
be songe to the Glory of God.”
The Puritans endeavored to put a
stop to carol-singing and practically
succeeded. Parliament, It will be re
membered, ordered the abolition of
Christmas Day and to show that It
had been abolished sat in session
December 25, 1652 —“commonly called
Christmas Day.”
But Christmas day came back with
the Restoration—and so did the Christ
mas Carol. In 1661 appeared a volume
with the title, “The New Carols for
the Merry Time of Christmas, to Sun
dry Pleasant Tunes.”
In France also the Christmas Carol
is very old. The French word for the
Christmas Carol is Noel. The Breton
word is “Koroll,” which means a dance.
Soel originally meant “birthday.” In
There was a long pause when noth
ing was accomplished.
“If you all don’t stop fussing and
compluining,” stated Bessie Brain in
a firm voice, “I won’t think another
thought! And then where would you
be? I run you all and have ten tim°s
the work; if you can’t obey orders for
a few hours to address Christmas
cards, you’re a wetty poor lot. Now
let’s start in once more, and not a
word out of you. There’s that nice
old Mrs. Hopkins—she must have a
card If nobody else does.’’
i, i
time it came to mean the “Birthday of
Jesus.” Still later it was a song about
His birthday. Nowadays a Frenchman
wishing anyone “Merry Christmas,”
says, “Joyeux Noel!’’
Now the title. “The First Nowell,"
of the English Christmas Carol, from
which quotation has been made in the
foregoing, throws a sidelight on his
tory. This carol.is probably more than
500 years old, although it did not ap
pear In print until 1533. The Norman
conquest of England was responsible
for the “Noel” in its title. And this
in turn was changed to “Nowell” to
make it look English and to insure its
pronunciation in two syllables.
“Silent Night” is probably one of
the most popular of all the Christinas
Carols. It seems to have been first
published in Leipsic as a “Tyrolean
Song.” Before that It had been in
the repertoire of a family of strolling
Tyrolean players. Its origin was then
unknown and it was said to be old.
In time it was credited to Michael
Haydn. A few years ago Ludwig Erk
made a thorough investigation and re
ported that “Silent Night” was written
and composed in 1818 at Oberndorf,
Germany; that Joseph Mohr, assistant
priest, wrote the words; that Franz
Gruber, a schoolmaster, wrote the
music. According to Erk, the carol
was produced Christmas Eve in the
church, the poet, a tenor, singing the
melody, and the composer singing
bass. A chorus of young women sang
the refrain. The church organ was
out of repair and the accompaniment
was played on a guitar.
“God Rest You Merry Gentlemen”
is believed to date back to the Seven
teenth Century. It certainly Is as
familiar to the English-speaking world
as any. One version has the first line,
“God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen”—
one does not know whether or not the
use of the comma is authorized.
It will be noted that the Christmas
Carols in general have a common char
acteristic—which Is especially promi
nent among the older ones: They are
set to pleasing and not dlflicult music;
they are simple in form and pic
turesque; they are often childlike in
their naivete. In short, they are real
bits of folklore.
Yet men famous In the world of
letters have not disdained to try their
hands at the Christmas Carol. For
example, “O tittle Town of Bethle
hem,” deservedly popular, was writ
ten by the Boston divine, Phillips
Brooks. It was intended for Sunday
schools only. Several composers have
written music for it. These include
Joseph Burnaby, the Englishman, and
Louis H. Redner, the American.
